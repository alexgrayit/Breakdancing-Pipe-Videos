# Breakdancing-Pipe-Videos
A repository containing recordings and animations for "The Breakdancing Pipe" project completed as part of the SSP program for PHYS2923 in 2025. Videos are common media files which can be downloaded and played on any common media player. All videos are 60 frames per second, so slowing the videos down to 50% speed still yields a smooth video.
